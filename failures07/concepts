ignore the failed tasks:
	ignore_errors:
		"By default if a task fails the playbook is aborted. This
		behaviour can be changed with ignore_errors"
Force execution of handlers:
	force_handlers:
		"By default if a task that notifies the handler fails then 
		it skips the handler. This handler is forced to execute using
		force_handlers"
Override the failed state:
	failed_when:
		"A task may succeed but based on some condition admin can
		change the state to fail"
Override the changed state:
	changed_when:
		"A handler is skipped if no change in the task. But admin can
		change the state to changed based on some condition so that
		handlers are executed"
